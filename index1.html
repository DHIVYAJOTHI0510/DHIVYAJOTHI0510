	<h3>Computer Security</h3>

	<p>Computer security, also called cybersecurity, is <u>the protection of computer systems and information from harm, theft, and unauthorized use.</u> Computer hardware is typically protected by the same means used to protect other valuable or sensitive equipment—namely, serial numbers, doors and locks, and alarms.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="c4">
	<h3>cloud computing</h3>

	<p>Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.</p>
	</div>
<div class="c5">
	<h3>Internet of things</h3>
	<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects—“things”—that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet.</p></div>
	<div class="c6">
		<h3>Human-Computer interation</h3>

		<p>The Association for Computing Machinery defines human-computer interaction, hereafter referred to as HCI, as "a discipline concerned with the design, evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them." But quite simply it is the study of ...</p></div><br>

		<h4> In Addition information...</h4>
		<p>In terms of domains in computer science, these three types of developers are related to web development, which is a subdomain in computer science. Web development focuses on building web applications that run on the World Wide Web or a private network. 

Other domains in computer science include artificial intelligence, computer graphics, databases, networking, programming languages, security, software engineering, and more. Each of these domains has different subtopics and areas of expertise, and each requires different skills and knowledge to work within.</p>

		<div class="block">
			<h4>Front end developers</h4>
			<p>A front-end developer <u>builds the front-end portion of websites and web applications</u>—the part users see and interact with. A front-end developer creates websites and applications using web languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allow users to access and interact with the site or app.</p></div>
			<div class="block">
				<h4>Back end developers</h4>
				<p>Back-end development means <u>working on server-side software, which focuses on everything you can't see on a website.</u> Back-end developers ensure the website performs correctly, focusing on databases, back-end logic, application programming interface (APIs), architecture, and servers.</p></div>
				<div class="block">
					<h4>Full stack developers </h4>
					<p>A full-stack developer is <u>a developer or engineer who can build both the front end and the back end of a website.</u> The front end (the parts of a website a user sees and interacts with) and the back end (the behind-the-scenes data storage and processing) require different skill sets.</p></div>
